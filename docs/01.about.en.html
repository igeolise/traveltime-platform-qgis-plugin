<h2>TravelTime platform plugin for QGIS</h2>

<p>The TravelTime API helps users find locations by journey time rather than using <i>as the crow flies</i> distance. Time-based searching gives users more opportunities for personalisation and delivers a more relevant search.</p>

<p>The plugin adds a toolbar offering easy access to all features.</p>

<p>The plugin is under active developpement, and currently only provides access to the Time Map feature.</p>
