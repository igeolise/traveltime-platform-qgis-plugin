<h2>TimeMap - Advanced</h2>

<p>The advanced algorithm maps as closely as possible with the TimeMap endpoint from the TravelTime platform API. Thus, it allows maximum flexibility, but requires a good understanding of the API to use correctly.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to get familiar with the simplified algorithm first, as it already covers most of the simple use cases.</p>

<p>The advanced dialog looks like this :</p>

<p>You will find an extensive explanation of all inputs on <a href="http://docs.traveltimeplatform.com/reference/time-map/">the API documentation page</a>.</p>

<p>Note that all inputs can be defined using QGIS expressions, meaning that you need to make sure to wrap your inputs in single quotes if you want to pass a string (for the transportation type for example).</p>

<p>
    There are two main differences with the API :
    <ul>
        <li>The API limits queries to 10 searches at a time. The plugin therefore runs multiple queries if the input dataset is bigger than 10 points.</li>
        <li>You cannot provide a list of searches for which to compute union/intersection ; instead, they are computed on ALL results</li>
    </ul>
</p>
